      <summary>Week 5: 2021-01-14 — Project progress</summary>

      <div>
        <p>
          Not too much happened this week—Mr. Robinson was out for a few days, and the others we worked on our projects. So far, I have the pencil insides and the cored wood. I need to 3D print the section that goes right before the tip. Once I trial and error the fit for that, it should be smooth sailing. Unless it’s the <em><a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Costa-Concordia-disaster">Costa Concordia</a></em> or something.

      <summary>Week 4: 2021-01-07 — Arduino shenanigans</summary>

      <div>
        <p>
          This week, we did some Arduino stuff. There was an introduction with using the on-board LED, and then an actual LED, if I remember correctly. Resistors still kind of baffle me—not in their function to reduce current, but in switches. For a tiny project, we were tasked to make some type of motion/distance sensor. I used a buzzer, and coded it so that it would beep more frequently as something got closer to the sensor.

      <summary>Mini project 2: 3D printer — Pen holder</summary>

      <div>
        <p>
          Our second mini project was to 3D print something. It’s not the most creative or complex thing to design, but I made a little pen stand. Here’s how it looks:
        </p>

            alt="The same stand closer to the camera at a 45° angle.">
          <figcaption>And at a different angle.</figcaption>

        <p>
          It measures 10&nbsp;cm long, 19&nbsp;mm across, and can hold a writing utensil up to 15&nbsp;mm in diameter where the supports are. It’s a bit rough around the edges, literally—printed with an Ultimaker with 0.2&nbsp;mm and 15% infill settings, it estimated that it would take <em>46 minutes</em>. For such a small project and little detail, that’s a long time. There was an idea of making them able to be stacked or joined in some way, but that would probably only work if the holders were bigger/sturdier.

      <summary>Week 3: 2021-12-17 — Wood shop</summary>

      <div>
        <p>
          This week, we did some stuff in the wood shop—learning the how to use the miter saw, scroll saw, and drill press. Using the tools was actually easier than I thought, but I guess using them <em>well</em> is difficult. Other than that, we mostly worked on 3D-printed projects and got those done.

      <summary>Final project: Update 1 — A basic idea</summary>

      <div>
        <p>
          My idea for my final project is to turn (literally, on the lathe) a piece of wood to make a mechanical pencil body. The mechanism will be taken from a Pentel Sharp P20x (P207 specifically, denoting 0.7&nbsp;mm lead).
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="media/final-1/p207.jpeg"
            alt="A picture of a blue mechanical pencil. The Pentel Sharp P207 in 0.7 mm, specifically.">
          <figcaption>The pencil.</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>
          It’s actually like the perfect pencil for this, as it doesn’t rely on some obscure geometry for the mechanism to work; it only needs a thinner section/lip to catch on near the tip so that the thing doesn’t slide out of the body. Furthermore, the tip screws into the mechanism itself, not the body, so that wouldn’t need to be re-made.
        </p>
      </div>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="media/final-1/p207-disassembled.jpeg"
            alt="A picture of a blue mechanical pencil, this time disassembled into its parts. The Pentel Sharp P207 in 0.7 mm, specifically.">
          <figcaption>The pencil disassembled.</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>
          Despite it costing only about $5, it’s really well made. For example, the <a href="https://spokedesign.com/">Spoke pencils</a> and these <a href="https://eyejayinstruments.com/pencils">IJ Instruments</a> ones use the same mechanism. Oh, and the missing chunk of mine is just from me wanting to see where the insides were “mounted” on the body.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>
          Ideally, the design would mimic that of a regular wooden pencil—hexagonal shape, but a wood texture. Perhaps slightly thicker, and maybe something different for the grip. I thought about using metal, but that would require using the 3D CNC machine, and that seems like a lot of work. Unless we figure out how it works, wood will do.

      <summary>Mini project 1: Laser cutter — Keychain</summary>

      <div>
        <p>
          This first mini project was to cut a keychain or small design on some wood with the laser cutter. Mine is a little exit sign based off of the signage found in the New York City subway, specifically from the <a href="https://standardsmanual.com/pages/original-nycta"><em>NYCTA Graphics Standards Manual</em></a>, the 1970s manual about the subway’s signage which is still used today.

          I actually own a reprint of the book, and it’s very interesting if you’re into that sort of thing. Back to the point, I want to bring up that the laser cutter made an almost checkerboard pattern for the gray area. I suspect if I choose 500 DPI (instead of 300), the text would be crisper. Currently, it looks almost pixelated because of what the laser has to do to make it a different shade. It was made with just some boxes and text in Inkscape—I don’t really think there’s much else to report there, besides that the laser cutter doesn’t seem to handle clipped areas too well; they’d just disappear from the print preview.

      <summary>Week 2: 2021-12-10 — Escape room stuff</summary>

      <div>
        <p>
          This week, we started building the two other escape room rooms. It will be Jekyll and Hyde themed. That is to say, one room plays as Dr. Jekyll, and the other, Mr. Hyde. I believe there will be an option for both “teams” to either work together to go to the third room, or escape separately. More about what happened, we worked on the actual rooms, by screwing together 2″&nbsp;×&nbsp;3″s, with power tools of course, and then attached luan[?] plywood to the frames to be the actual walls. Not the <em>most</em> exciting ever, but it was alright. We also got to use the table saw to cut the plywood, and somehow getting the measurements wrong, but I believe it turned out alright in the end. On the matter of the final project, that’s still to be decided, and will be put in its own post.

      <summary>Week 1: 2021-12-03 — First post</summary>

      <div>
        <p>
          This week, we had an quick tour of the Hub as well as the woodshop. More in detail, we went over 3D-printing and the Epilog laser cutter. The former: an overview of 3D printing—advantages and disadvantages, the types of filament, support structures, finding 3D models online, and slicing them to print. Also instructions on how to change the filament type, on the Ultimaker and Prusa. For the latter: a bit about Inkscape, how to specify cut vs. engrave, and converting a bitmap to vector.
