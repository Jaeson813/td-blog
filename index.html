      <summary>Week 2: 2021-12-10 — Escape room stuff</summary>

      <div>
        <p>
          This week, we started building the two other escape room rooms. It will be Jekyll and Hyde themed. That is to say, one room plays as Dr. Jekyll, and the other, Mr. Hyde. I believe there will be an option for both “teams” to either work together to go to the third room, or escape separately. More about what happened, we worked on the actual rooms, by screwing together 2″&nbsp;×&nbsp;3″s, with power tools of course, and then attached luan[?] plywood to the frames to be the actual walls. Not the <em>most</em> exciting ever, but it was alright. We also got to use the table saw to cut the plywood, and somehow getting the measurements wrong, but I believe it turned out alright in the end. On the matter of the final project, that’s still to be decided, and will be put in its own post.

        <p>
          This week, we had an quick tour of the Hub as well as the woodshop. More in detail, we went over 3D-printing and the Epilog laser cutter. The former: an overview of 3D printing—advantages and disadvantages, the types of filament, support structures, finding 3D models online, and slicing them to print. Also instructions on how to change the filament type, on the Ultimaker and Prusa. For the latter: a bit about Inkscape, how to specify cut vs. engrave, and converting a bitmap to vector.
